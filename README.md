# tower-builder

Tower Builder is a hypercasual 3D game made in Unity. The goal is to build a tower without letting it fall or sway too much. Sounds easy? Here's the catch: blocks are random, and you never know what block will spawn next.


# Notes on Supported Platforms

The game is built primarily for Android. I do believe that you should be able to build this for other platforms like iOS or even Windows/Mac/Linux using the files and code provided in the repository, but I do not provide any such guarantees yet.

# How to Run?

To run the project, you need to have Unity 6 and C# .NET installed. Open the project in Unity and create a build to run it on your machine.
